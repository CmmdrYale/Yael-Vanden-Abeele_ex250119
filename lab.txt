Exercise:

A research lab keeps track of all projects PhD students and lab technicians work on. This data consists of

    Personnel number
    Name
    Date of birth
    Lab code
    Lab name
    Research code
    Research description
    Research supervisor

Normalise this data up to 3NF, taking in to account these constraints:

    Each personnel number is unique
    Each lab has a single lab code
    Each research project has a single code and supervisor
    Each member of the personnel may work on one or more research projects
    Personnel names need not necessarily be unique
    Research code, description and supervisor are repeating fields
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

UNF 
***
laboratory(Personnel_number, Name, Birthdate, lab_code, lab_name, research_code, research_descr, research_superv)

1NF (no repeating groups, all atomic values)
***
Personnel(Personnel_number, Name, Day-of-birth, lab_code, research_code)
	candidate keys(Personnel_number)
Laboratory(lab_ID, lab_name)
	candidate keys(lab_ID)
Research(research_ID, research_descr, research_superv)
	candidate keys(research_ID)

Laboratory and research groups were split up as these values can be linked to the same entity. Candidate keys were assigned possible integer values, which cannot be null and have to be filled in. Because the personnel_number only links to name and name links on their term to someone's birthdate. Labcode refers to the lab-name and research_code refers to research description and correlated supervisor.

2NF
***

Non-key columns should be dependent on primary key

Personnel(Personnel_number, Name)
	candidate keys (Personnel_number)
Birthdate(personnel_id, date-of-birth) - split because personnel number does not link to birthdate and several people could have the same birthdate, hence other column
	candidate keys (personnel_id)
Laboratory(lab_id, lab_name)
	candidate keys (lab_id)
Research(research_ID, research_descr, research_superv, supervisor_number)
	candidate keys (research_ID)
Join-table(supervisor_ID, research_ID) supervisors can have different projects

3NF

Personnel(Personnel_number, Name)
	candidate key(Personnel_number, Birthdate)
Laboratory(lab_id, lab_name)
	candidate key(lab_id)
Research(research_ID, research_descr, supervisor_number)
	candidate key(research_ID, supervisor_number)
